The latest published documentation for this project can be found *here*.

.. todo::

   Publish the documentation somewhere (ReadTheDocs?) and insert a link in the
   sentence above.


Conventions
===========

*   The project top-level directory is also the source root.
*   We use PyTest for tests.
*   PyTest can be integrated with SetupTools (see
    https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html). We donâ€™t do this.
*   Common commands for builds, distributing, packaging, documentation etcetera
    are in :file:`Makefile` and :file:`docs/Makefile`.
*   RST-files and -docstrings are indented with 4 spaces.
*   Globals must be immutable.
*   Docstrings are formatted like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        """This is a one-line docstring."""
        """One line description, terminated with a period.

        More info, with a trailing empty line.

        """
